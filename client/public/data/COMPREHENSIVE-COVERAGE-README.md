- Provide search across all categories

## Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Example of comprehensive mapping function
function mapAllVersesToTopics() {
  const allVerses = loadAllArabicVerses();
  const topicMappings = {};
  
  allVerses.forEach(verse => {
    const assignedTopics = [];
    
    // Check against all topic patterns
    COMPREHENSIVE_TOPICS.forEach(topic => {
      if (matchesTopicPatterns(verse.text, topic.patterns)) {
        assignedTopics.push(topic.id);
      }
    });
    
    // Ensure at least one topic assignment
    if (assignedTopics.length === 0) {
      assignedTopics.push(getDefaultTopic(verse));
    }
    
    topicMappings[`${verse.surah}:${verse.ayah}`] = assignedTopics;
  });
  
  return topicMappings;
